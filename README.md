**SOLTEC.ERP** (**Enterprise Resources Planning**). The concept refers to a type of software that enables the integration of a company's processes, systems and tools into a centralized platform. By definition, it standardizes workflows and improves operational efficiency and increases team productivity, which is achieved through a unified view of data and process automation.

The truth is that companies that do not automate processes spend excessive time on tasks that could be performed with the help of technology.

This software can be complemented with:

* A **CRM** (**SOLTEC.CRM**); an acronym that stands for **Customer Relationship Management** and is translated into Spanish
  as **Customer Relationship Management System**. It facilitates the monitoring of conversations with customers. This type of software allows you to identify consumption habits, anticipate needs and make strategic decisions based on behavioral trends.
* A **SCM** (**SOLTEC.SCM**); an acronym that stands for **Supply Chain Management** and is translated into Spanish
  as **Supply Chain Management System**. It facilitates a set of practices and technologies used to
  manage and optimize the supply chain, from the purchase of raw materials, through production and
  distribution, until they arrive at the end customer's home.
* A **WMS** (**SOLTEC.WMS**); an acronym that stands for **Warehouse Management System** and is translated into Spanish
  as **Warehouse Management System**. Which facilitates maintaining the stock values ​​of the items and their positions in the warehouse correctly and all the information on the movements of the items within a warehouse is achieved by recording all the physical movements of the warehouse and then consulting them in the database.
* A **MIS** (**SOLTEC.MIS**); an acronym that means **Management Information System** and is translated into Spanish as **Management Information System**. Which facilitates an overview of the company's situation.
  Consequently, these show the status of the company's regular operations so that managers can control, organize, plan and direct.
